Discovery fo an open cluster near Alpha Scuti

Thanks to surveys like Gaia open clusters have been discovered by hundreds (cite cantat)
or even thousands (cite Liu, kounkel I & II) in the last threee years.
Howewer, it seems the completeness for clusters up to few kpc is not yet achieved
because more clusters are still being dicovered (put citations here).
The missing clusters are probably younger clusters (cite cantat) or clusters in very crowded
areas of the Milky way. Besides that, no ML algorithm is perfect, so it's possible they
missed a few genuine clusters. For a comparison among many algorithms, see (cite)
Here I report the result of a search on one such crowded areas: the Scutum constellation.
It resulted in the discovery of a new cluster located near, but not associated to Alpha Sct

We did a visual search for stellar concentrations in Scutum area using Aladin and checked if a
putative concentration is or is not known and if not, we checked it's stars kinematics and parallaxes
using Gaia DR3 to see if there's any evidence that those stars could be related and form an open cluster.
A small 1.5' arc consisting of 9 stars with visual magnitudes 13-15 plus some surrounding scattering
of stars was found only 9.2' north of Alpha Scuti (V= 3.83). A quick check in Gaia EDR3 suggested
the presence of a cluster at ~2 Kpc and with proper motions centered at 0, -1 mas/yr.

The figure xx shows a yy' DSS2 color field centered on the small arc. Alpha Sct galre is visible
in the bottom.
