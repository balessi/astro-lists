Add associated errors
Add number of members
Add mag of brightest member (and/or mag range)
Add metallicity

Separate aliases from associated Objs

Check for more associated objects
like WR, OB, bright stars, etc

Correct types column
(see age section)

Complete distance column
check Vizier
adopt distance of member star
adop distance of companion obj

Complete E(B-V) column
one suggestion: check for stars in Gontcharov
another: use reddening maps
another: pick E(B-V) from members stars

Complete Age column                
using types if necessary. For example, median of ECs is 6.70 +- 0.82
but there are ECs with ages > 2sigma - either the type or age is incorrect
other source: pick ages for members stars

--------------------------------------------------

Median ages before correction

EC     6.74 +- 0.50
YA     7.03 +- 0.65
OB     7.10 +- 0.40
RSG    7.20 +- 0.10
OC     8.24 +- 0.49
MG     8.30 +- 0.24                                   
GC    10.08 +- 0.02
UFD   10.08 +- 0.02 

directives

If we have a star of a known ST that is in MS, use as upper limit the age from Mamajek's table and as a lower limit:
    a) the typical age of ECs plus 1 sigma if the cluster is not an EC
    b) log-T = 5.7 if it's an EC
If t1
he star is wolf-rayet then use 6.25 +- 0.25 (mean of upper ages of stars with ZAMS masses betw 20 and 60+ MS)
