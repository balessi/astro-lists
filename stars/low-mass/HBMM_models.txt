Notes:

[1] The Optical ST of 2MASSI J0523382-140302 is L2.5, but IR ST is L5 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11616)
If you use subtype 2.5 to calculate the median, the resulting value MAD is 1.5 (the median is the same)
If you adopt the middle ground between Optical and IR STs, that is 3.75, then MAD decreases to 0.5
Dieterich's Teff is 2075 K, but it is listed as 1939 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11616 - I adopted 2007K, the middle ground

[2] We interpret this newly-discerned "kinematic break" around spectral types L5–L6 to be an observable of the terminus of the stellar Main Sequence.
The effective temperature range of L5–L6 dwarfs, 1500K-1600K (Filippazzo et al. 2015), corresponds to evolutionary model predictions for the HBMM
at ages of 4–5 Gyr (Baraffe et al. 2003), in rough agreement with the average age of the local UCD population.
Dupuy & Liu (2017) identify a similar HBMM boundary at slightly earlier spectral types of L3–L5 based on the distribution of 38 dynamical mass
measurements from binaries; while Dieterich et al. (2014) anchor the HBMM at ~2075 K, corresponding to L1–L2 subtypes, based on an inferred radius minimum.
The differences among these empirical indicators of the HBMM may reflect both sample variations and sensitivity to specific brown dwarf indicators.
For example, the L1–L2 range may represent a threshold in the brown dwarf-to-star ratio in the field population,
while the L5-L6 range represents the disappearance of stars entirely.

[3] Threshold defined at 90-99% SHBMM (steady hydrogen burning minimum mass) - the mass range I put is for solar metallicity
T-BDs can reach states of minimum temperature and pressure to fuse hydrogen at low rate in their cores to replenish the dissipation of their
initial thermal energy. The unsteady hydrogen fusion in T-BDs could last for >>10 Gyr
D-BDs are the vast majority of BDs that do not fuse hydrogen and keep cooling through their lifetime

A frozen star, besides a disused term for a black hole, is a type of hypothetical star that, according to the astronomers Fred Adams and Gregory P. Laughlin,
may appear in the future of the Universe when the metallicity of the interstellar medium is several times the solar value.
Due to opacity effects, as metallicity of the interstellar gas increases both the maximum and minimum masses a star can have will decrease.
For the latter case, it's expected that an object with a mass of 0.04 MSun, that currently would become a brown dwarf unable to fuse hydrogen,
could do so ending in the main sequence with a surface temperature of 0 °C (273 K, thus frozen), much cooler than the dimmest red dwarfs of today,
and ice clouds forming in its atmosphere. The luminosity of these objects would be more than a thousand times lower than the faintest stars 
currently existing and their lifetimes would also be sensibly longer.

There is an increasing number of T dwarfs with dynamically measured masses in excess 60 MJup:

Notice how close Epsilon Indi Ba mass is to the median HBMM for solar metallicity (thin disk) stars I calculated above.
This suggests it is a very massive BD, almost at HBMM, but contrary to a star, it will continue cooling as time goes by
therefore that's why it is cooler than the L4 type expected for the HBMM.
BTW, the age for Epsilon indi is 5.10 +- 0.51 Gyr (median of several ages in literature)
